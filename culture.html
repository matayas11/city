                The festival will feature street dancing in the main avenue of Dipolog City. This will then culminate in a cultural presentation depicting dances involving the different types if people in Mindanao. The concept is “Unity in diversity among the tri-people” because as the objectives state, it aims to promote peace and harmony among the three people who call Mindanao their home. Literally translated the festival’s title means: “togetherness among three people with diverse culture.”
