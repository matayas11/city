                Dr. Jose Rizal landed here at seven o’clock in the evening of July 17, 1892 on board SS Cebu manned by Captain Delgras with three artillery men to begin his life as an exile. They walked to Sta. Cruz Street with Farol de Combate going to Casa Real. This is the ultimate expression of glorifying the greatest local historical date of July 17, 1892—the arrival of our national hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal here in Dapitan change the course of his destiny. Punto is 10 feet tall and the monument valued 35 million marks the spot where he first set foot many years ago in Dapitan. It is an elevated semi-circular structure and has the area of 1,500 sq m. It has both aesthetic and functional purposes. At the raised center is the human life in size statues. The figures are: Dr. Jose P. Rizal, Capt. Delgras, the SS Cebu skipper, and the three artillery men waving from the sea going to Casa Real using Farol de Combateas their lights. Both sides are promenading areas with bromite flooring finished and enclosed with art design concrete balustrade with granite nails. Farther side also a landscaped sunset viewing the areas with 16 high post. Added attraction is a mini-waterfall and at the back of the raised center is a tiny lagoon around it. Mr. Tony Tuviera did the research for the molding and the specification of the statues including the Farol de Combate held and hats worn by men were made based on the recorded description. Even the face of Rizal was molded as close to his picture on the records as they can get it. Mr. Ronel Roces, a former assistant of sculptor Mr. Napoleon Abueva sculpted the statues. The whole project was secured with shorelines protection composed of steel file and stone masonry riprap. The historical landmark is funded by the Local Government Unit of Dapitan, Province of Zamboanga del Norte and by donations from prominent personalities who valued the ideals, teachings, courage, and sacrifices of our national hero. Ground breaking ceremony took place on December 29, 2009.

                The P'gsalabuk Circle is a must-visit landmark located at Barangay Estaka and Turno Junction. The resin-made figure is capturing tourists for its unique design of three people symbolizing the three diverse culture of Dipolog to include the Lumads, Muslims, and Christians. They hold a bowl raised to the heavens as a gesture of thanksgiving to the Almighty God. It also appeals to God for the generous outpouring of grace, peace, and prosperity. The pouring water from the bowl signifies the answer to the prayer of the tri-people to continuously bless the City of Dipolog. The dazzling lights at night make it a marvel for photographers.
